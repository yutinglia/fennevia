# Architecture Decisions

This file records the active high-level decisions. Add a new entry for a major change rather than silently rewriting historical reasoning. Mark an older decision as superseded when a later decision replaces it.

## ADR-001: Use stock Firefox, not a source fork

**Status:** Accepted

Use the official Firefox binary and install the custom shell through AutoConfig, Chrome Registry registration, and a privileged runtime.

**Reasoning:** This avoids downloading, compiling, merging, branding, and releasing the full Firefox source tree. The tradeoff is dependence on unsupported internal APIs and the limits of runtime hooks.

## ADR-002: Do not build a general-purpose userChrome loader

**Status:** Accepted

The bootstrap does not scan `.uc.js`, parse userscript metadata, or provide arbitrary-script sandbox and compatibility behavior.

**Reasoning:** This repository contains one controlled application. Generic discovery, legacy compatibility, cache abstraction, and arbitrary userscript execution are unnecessary attack surface and maintenance cost.

Alice0775, fx-autoconfig, and similar projects are compatibility research sources only.

## ADR-003: Use Chrome Registry as the resource boundary

**Status:** Accepted and validated by Phase 1; package label superseded by
ADR-017; mapping policy amended by ADR-016

Reserve project-owned `chrome://my-firefox-shell/` and `resource://my-firefox-shell/` namespaces so privileged modules, UI assets, and styles do not depend on absolute file paths. Register only mappings with a concrete consumer and reviewed inventory.

Phase 1 validated Chrome package registration, immediate import, cache behavior, default content denial, and complete removal on Firefox 153.0.4. The initial manifest registers only the required Chrome content package.

The namespace literals above record the placeholder identity used by the
original Phase 1 experiment. ADR-017 changes the active package label to
`fennevia` without changing this resource-boundary decision.

## ADR-004: Do not override `browser.xhtml` during the initial roadmap

**Status:** Accepted

Keep Firefox's main-window markup and includes. Add isolated project-owned hosts after load and later hide only replaced visible native UI.

**Reasoning:** A complete override would require tracking every upstream structural and security change, making maintenance resemble an uncompiled fork and risking omission of startup, dialog, popup, and security infrastructure.

## ADR-005: Use isolated frontend islands

**Status:** Accepted

The frontend framework mounts only into project-created XHTML roots. Firefox-owned DOM is never reconciled by the framework.

Svelte 5 is the initial candidate and must pass a production-build and XHTML lifecycle spike. A failed Svelte spike may replace the frontend implementation without changing bootstrap and bridge contracts.

## ADR-006: Access Firefox internals only through bridges

**Status:** Accepted

Dependencies on `gBrowser`, Services, Places, SessionStore, Downloads, commands, native DOM, and related internals are concentrated in `src/firefox/` and a minimal amount of runtime bootstrap code.

**Reasoning:** Firefox update fixes remain localized, while UI state and components remain testable and replaceable.

## ADR-007: Hide native UI behind a health gate; do not delete it

**Status:** Accepted

Set the active state only after frontend mount and required capability checks succeed. CSS hides native visible UI only while active. Failure leaves native UI usable.

**Reasoning:** Firefox code may continue to rely on native elements, and the retained DOM provides a recovery path.

## ADR-008: Isolate overrides and default to zero

**Status:** Accepted

`patches/` starts empty. Any manifest override, monkey patch, or internal script replacement requires a dedicated issue, source pin, tests, update process, and removal plan.

## ADR-009: Latest stable only; Windows first

**Status:** Accepted

Development guarantees only the current Firefox stable. The first install and test workflow targets Windows. Do not add historical-version compatibility branches. Do not claim cross-platform support before testing it.

## ADR-010: Generated artifacts are not the source of truth

**Status:** Accepted

Production JavaScript and CSS are generated from TypeScript, Svelte, and source styles. Never hand-edit `dist/`. Builds must be deterministic and free of runtime CDN or dev-server dependencies.

## ADR-011: Failure must expose native Firefox UI

**Status:** Accepted

Unknown, timeout, partial, or failed states do not activate native-UI hiding. Emergency fallback and safe start are release gates rather than optional convenience features.

**Reasoning:** The project modifies the primary browser control surface with system-principal code. A closed failure mode could make recovery impractical.

## ADR-012: No runtime remote executable dependencies

**Status:** Accepted

The installed runtime does not fetch executable JavaScript, CSS, fonts, configuration, templates, analytics scripts, or updates from remote endpoints.

**Reasoning:** Remote content would expand the privileged attack surface, reduce reproducibility, and complicate offline recovery.

## ADR-013: Minimize and redact diagnostics

**Status:** Accepted

Normal diagnostics exclude complete URLs, page titles, search text, history, profile paths, cookies, tokens, and private-window state. More detailed debugging requires explicit local opt-in and must not become a network telemetry path.

## ADR-014: Preserve Firefox security-sensitive UI until separately reviewed

**Status:** Accepted

Permissions, authentication, certificates, file pickers, extension installation, download safety, and other security-sensitive prompts remain native Firefox infrastructure during the initial roadmap.

**Reasoning:** Replacing these surfaces safely is a separate security project and is not required to replace the everyday visible shell.

## ADR-015: Default Chrome and resource exposure to zero

**Status:** Superseded in part by ADR-016; package label superseded by ADR-017;
the minimal initial-manifest decision remains accepted

Reserve both project-owned namespaces, but initially register only `content my-firefox-shell ...` without `contentaccessible=yes`. Omit a `resource://my-firefox-shell/` alias until a dedicated review defines an exact inert/public file inventory and validates access from ordinary web content.

**Historical reasoning (superseded):** Mozilla's Chrome Registration documentation used during Phase 0.5 says `contentaccessible=yes` explicitly exposes a content package to untrusted references and separately warns that web content is not prevented from including files at `resource:` aliases. A dedicated project name prevents namespace collision; it does not create a privilege boundary.

Privileged modules, source maps, debug artifacts, diagnostics, and private assets must not be placed in a resource alias. Any later alias or content-accessibility flag is a security-review trigger and must include the exact manifest lines, mapped file inventory, callers, content-context tests, and removal behavior.

The statement above about default `resource:` access came from the older `build/docs/chrome-registration.rst` wording. Firefox 153's newer `toolkit/docs/internal-urls.md` and the Phase 1 runtime test establish the replacement policy in ADR-016; this historical reasoning is retained rather than silently rewritten.

## ADR-016: Follow Firefox's current internal-URL access model and omit unused mappings

**Status:** Accepted; active package label superseded by ADR-017

Firefox 153 treats both `chrome:` and `resource:` mappings as privileged-only by default. A manifest `contentaccessible=yes` flag deliberately hole-punches that boundary and exposes the mapped package to web content.

The Phase 1 manifest therefore contains only:

```text
content my-firefox-shell content/
```

It omits `resource`, `skin`, `locale`, `style`, `override`, and `contentaccessible=yes`. The resource alias is omitted because there is no Phase 1 consumer and the smallest registered surface is easiest to audit, not because a default resource mapping is content-accessible.

**Reasoning:** The supported Firefox 153 source revision `54be19de0e08edff0b797e55fd935dd3978b0a6d` documents the default restriction in `toolkit/docs/internal-urls.md`. An ordinary loopback HTTP page also failed to fetch the project Chrome entry in the real spike. Any later mapping requires a concrete consumer, exact file inventory, current-source review, ordinary-content access test, and removal test. `contentaccessible=yes` remains rejected without a dedicated security issue.

The manifest line above is the exact historical Phase 1 declaration. The
active equivalent after ADR-017 is `content fennevia content/`; declaration
semantics and exposure requirements are unchanged.

## ADR-017: Adopt the Fennevia project and package identity

**Status:** Accepted

Replace the provisional `my-firefox-shell` identity with **Fennevia** before
the installer makes paths and ownership records durable. Active project-owned
identifiers are:

```text
Fennevia
fennevia
chrome://fennevia/
resource://fennevia/        # reserved; still omitted until a real consumer
fennevia.safeStart
[Fennevia <subsystem>]
data-fennevia-*
```

The AutoConfig files are `defaults/pref/fennevia.js` and `fennevia.cfg`; the
profile package is `chrome/fennevia/`. Development-only profile state moves to
the separately marker-owned `%LOCALAPPDATA%\fennevia\profiles\fennevia-dev`
root.

**Reasoning:** The old name was an implementation placeholder. Selecting the
product identity before issue #4 avoids baking a temporary label into install,
update, ownership-manifest, and removal contracts. This changes names only:
the minimal AutoConfig chain, privileged boundary, fail-open behavior,
content-access policy, and omitted resource alias remain the same.

No dual Chrome namespace, preference alias, marker adoption, or automatic
deletion of the old development root is added. The project has no released
installer or supported user migration to preserve, and silently adopting or
removing a differently named profile would weaken ownership checks. Historical
Phase 1 literals remain in their research record and in the superseded portions
of these decisions.

## ADR-018: Use a manifest-driven dual-root transaction for package lifecycle

**Status:** Accepted

Stabilize the Phase 1 installable source at `program/` and
`profile/chrome/fennevia/`, with `package-manifest.json` as the sole versioned
path and SHA-256 inventory. Install identical ownership records below
`<PROGRAM>/.fennevia/` and `<PROFILE>/.fennevia/`; each record binds one
installation UUID, package version/state, source-manifest hash, exact files,
installed relative paths, and only the profile directories created by the
package action.

Every non-empty mutation uses marker-owned same-volume transaction roots. It
stages and verifies new bytes, backs up only ownership-proven existing files,
writes a relative-path/hash recovery journal, rechecks old hashes before
replacement, rolls back caught partial failure, and rejects later actions while
transaction residue exists. Hard disable moves the AutoConfig preference out of
the active `defaults/pref/*.js` set and therefore does not depend on a working
manifest or runtime entry. Startup-cache mutation remains evidence-driven and is
never part of normal file cleanup.

**Reasoning:** Installation spans a Firefox program and one explicitly selected
profile, so a single-root copy script cannot prove atomicity or safe removal.
Byte-identical records prevent either root from silently claiming a different
installation. Exact hashes distinguish owned content from same-name foreign or
manually changed files. Same-volume staging and journals make ordinary failure
rollback deterministic and interrupted-operation recovery inspectable without
recording absolute personal paths.

The installer never adopts arbitrary customizations, scans for generic scripts,
chooses a default/registered profile, recursively removes a Firefox, profile, or
general `chrome` parent, or clears arbitrary cache directories. The Windows-first
development workflow and its current copied-program support boundary are
documented in `docs/installation.md`.

## ADR-019: Manage browser windows at Firefox delayed startup with strict project-owned cleanup

**Status:** Accepted and validated on Firefox 153.0.4

Keep one process-global Fennevia runtime. Its `WindowManager` first registers
for `browser-delayed-startup-finished`, then enumerates already-existing
`navigator:browser` windows. It accepts only an open top-level chrome window
whose exact document is `chrome://browser/content/browser.xhtml`, exact root
`windowtype` is `navigator:browser`, and delayed-startup flag is true. A weak
identity set allows at most one initialization attempt per window.

Normal and private browser windows receive the same base lifecycle. Firefox's
`PrivateBrowsingUtils.isWindowPrivate()` performs classification before any
initializer runs. Every context has a process-local random UUID, an
`AbortSignal`, and a cleanup registry. Window unload and process-runtime stop
abort pending work and deterministically dispose all registered resources;
stop is idempotent. A late asynchronous initializer result is disposed
immediately and cannot revive a closed record.

**Reasoning:** Firefox 153 sets the delayed-startup flag, resolves its startup
promise, and then publishes the browser-specific observer topic. Firefox's own
`EveryWindow` module uses the same enumerator and readiness boundary. Registering
before enumeration closes the discovery race, while exact browser identity
checks avoid the generic dialog/document handling carried by customization
loaders. A project-owned manager is retained instead of importing
`EveryWindow` because Fennevia requires explicit runtime stop, cancellation,
privacy-safe window identity, initialization-failure rollback, and a future
host initializer contract.

This decision adds no generic script discovery, historical Firefox branches,
Svelte UI, host elements, native-UI hiding, Chrome Registry mapping, override,
runtime network behavior, or third-party dependency. The pinned research,
canary differences, automated tests, real normal/private-window matrix, and
fail-open injection are recorded in
`docs/research/firefox-153-window-lifecycle.md`.
